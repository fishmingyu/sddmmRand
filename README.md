A simple tool to genertate random matrix for sddmm
* the right CSR form is showed in <kbd>sparseCSR.txt</kbd>
* the right COO form is showed in <kbd>sparseCOO.txt</kbd> 
* the C language api COO->CSR is in <kbd>readCSR.cpp</kbd>
* the right answer of SDDMM with CSR format is presented in <kbd>outputCSR.txt</kbd>
* the right answer of SDDMM with COO format is presented in <kbd>outputCOO.txt</kbd>
You can use these generated data to test and verify your sddmm-kernel
